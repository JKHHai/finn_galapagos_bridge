# Overview
This repository contains Intellectual Property (IP) which will allow FINN cores to be deployed across multiple Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA's) using Galapagos.

# Introduction
[FINN](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn): FINN is an open-source hardware acceleration library which accelerates Binarized Neural Networks (BNN's). FINN is being developed by researchers at Xilinx Research Labs. 
[Galapagos](https://github.com/UofT-HPRC/galapagos): Galapagos is an open-source hardware-and-software stack that partitions Hardware Designs and deploys them across multiple FPGAs for faster computation. Galapagos is being developed by researchers at the University of Toronto High Performance Reconfigurable Computing Group (UofT-HPRC).
